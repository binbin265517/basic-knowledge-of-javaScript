(1)、What happen if you create a new arrow function?
The arrow fucntion i introduced in ES6. It does not have a prototype, nor does it have its own thi reference, and it cannot use the arguments parameter. Therefore, it is not possible to use the new operator with an arrow function.

The steps to implement the new operator are as follows:

1、Create a new object

2、Assign the constructors function's scope to the new object(in other words, set the obejct's proto property to point to the constructor function's prototype property)

3、Point to the code in the constructor, and this in the constructor points to the object(That is, to add properties and methods to the object)

4、Return a new object

Therefore, the arrow function in the above steps canot be executed.

（2）、The defference between arrow functions and ordinaly functions?

1. Arrow functions are more cancise than ordinaly functions.
2. Arrow functions do not have their own 'this' keyword.
3. The pointer inherted from the arrow function never change.
4. The methods call()、apply()、bind() etc. cannot change the reference of 'this' in arrow functions
5. Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors
6. Arrow function do not have their own arguments.
7. Arrow function do not have a prototype
8. Arrow function cannot be used Generator function and cannot use the yeild keyword.
