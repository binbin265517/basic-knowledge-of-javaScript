Understanding of async/await

Async/await is actually the synctax sugar of Generator. The effect it can achieve can be realized by the then chain. It was developed to optimize the then chanin. Literally, async is the abbreviation of "asynchronous", await is waiting, so it is easy to understand that async is used to declare that a function is asynchronous, and await is used to wait for an asynchronous methods to complete, Of course, the syntax forces that await can only appear in the async function. Let's first look at what the async function returns:

```js
async function testAsy() {
  return 'hello world'
}
let result = testAsy()
console.log(result);
```

Therefore, an async function returns a Promise objecty. Async functions, including function statments, function expressions, and Lambda expressions, all return  a Promise object. If a literal value is returned from the function, async wraps this value width Promise,resolve(),. converting it into a Promise object .

An async function returns a Promsie object. Therefore, when it's not possible to use await at the outermost level to abtain its returns value, the appropriate approach is to use the original method: handling the Promise object with a then() chain, like this:

```js
async function testAsy() {
   return 'hello world'
}
let result = testAsy()
console.log(result)
result.then(v => {
    console.log(v); // hello world
})
```

What if the async function does not return a value? It is easy to imagine that it will return Promise.resolve(undefined)

Think about the characteristics of Promise ---namely, their non-blocking nature --executing an async function without await results in tis immediate execution, returning a Promise object without blocking subsequent statments. This behavior is consistent with functions that reurn a Promise object.

Note: Promise.resolve(x) can be viewed as a shorthand for new Promise(resolve => resolve(x)). It is used to quickly wrap literal objects or other objects into Pormise instances.
